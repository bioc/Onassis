@article{Verspoor:2009b,
    abstract = {{This paper discusses the design of a ``generic'' UIMA type system, in which the type system itself is a lightweight meta-model and genericity is achieved by referencing an external object model containing the full semantic complexity desired for the application. This allows arbi- trarily complex semantic types to be manipulated and created by UIMA components, without requiring representation of domain-specific types within the type system itself. A meta-model type system further allows for the definition of a single type system that can be used in a wide array of contexts, supporting an even wider array of semantic types.}},
