Title	MCF7_E2_10min_H3K4me3
Sample type	SRA

Source name	MCF7
Organism	Homo sapiens
Characteristics	tissue: mammary gland
cell line: MCF7
chip antibody: H3K4me3 (Diagenode, pAb-MEHAHS-024, lot HS-0010)
treatment: 10min
Treatment protocol	MCF-7 cells were mock treated or with 10nM 17b-E2 at a series of time points.
Growth protocol	MCF-7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS at 37 °C. Cells were maintained in DMEM w/o phenol red and 5% charcoal stripped FCS for 72 hours before induction.
Extracted molecule	genomic DNA
Extraction protocol	Lysates were clarified from sonicated nuclei and histone-DNA complexes were isolated with antibody using the Transcription factor protocol. Settings: 20 min cross-linking and 20min sonication for H3K4me3 and H2A.Zac, 15min resp. 10min for F3A6 (to ERalpha). 100 µl chromatin and 2.5µl antibody. Pooled 2 samples.
Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the DNA Sample Kit (Part# 0801-0303). Briefly, DNA was end-repaired using a combination of T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow fragment (32 to 52 exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for ligation of Illumina's adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the 3’ end. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers for 15 cycles and library fragments of ~250 bp (insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences) were band isolated from an agarose gel. The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on the Genome Analyzer following the manufacturer's protocols.

Description	1931
Data processing	Mapping was done using the GenomatixMapper software (version 3.4) onto the hg19 whole genome for the given time points. No trimming was applied to the reads. Only reads mapping uniquely to the genome with at most 2 mismatches were reported.
