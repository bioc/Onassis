Organism	Homo sapiens
Characteristics	cell type: colorectal cancer cell line
cell characteristics: mesenchymal, derived from colonospheres
chip antibody: H3K27me3
Growth protocol	Colorectal cancer cell line DLD1 and its derivatives were maintained in McCoy`s 5A Medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin.
Extracted molecule	genomic DNA
Extraction protocol	Lysates were clarified from sonicated nuclei and histone-DNA complexes were precipitated with indicated histone antibodies using the Diagenode iDeal ChIP-seq & library preparation kit according to manufacturers instructions
Libraries were prepared with Diagenode iDeal ChIP-seq & library preparation kit according to manufacturers instructions

Library strategy	ChIP-Seq

Description	SPH (mesenchymal-like DLD1 derivative) colorectal cancer cell line
Data processing	CLC Genomics Workbench 7.5 software was used
The raw reads were cleaned by trimming of adaptor sequences.
Sequenced reads were mapped to hg19 genome using CLC Workbench default parameters
Peaks were called with the ChIP-seq analysis module of the CLC Genomics Workbench software
Genome_build: hg19
Supplementary_files_format_and_content: tab-delimited text file with peak coordinates and number of reads under the peak
