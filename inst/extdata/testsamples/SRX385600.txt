Title	ChIP-seq analysis of coronavirus-infected human cells
Organism	Homo sapiens
Experiment type	Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing
Summary	The aim of the experiment is to identify chromatin and transcription factor binding dynamics in host gene expression upon infection of human Huh7 hepatoma carcinoma cells with human coronavirus HCoV-229E as compared to uninfected cells and in comparison to cells stimulated by IL-1alpha (10ng/ml) for 1h. All experiments have been performed at 33Â°C which is required for sufficient viral entry/replication.

Overall design	ChIP-seq
